# PyTorch-Workflow-Fundamentals
A typical PyTorch workflow involves a sequence of fundamental steps to take a dataset and build a predictive model. This process provides a standard structure for nearly any machine learning task

# 1. Prepare and Load Data
The first step is to get your data ready for the model. This involves loading a dataset and converting it into PyTorch's primary data structure: the tensor.

PyTorch provides two key utilities for this: torch.utils.data.Dataset and torch.utils.data.DataLoader. Dataset stores the samples and their corresponding labels, while DataLoader wraps an iterable around the Dataset to enable easy access to the data. DataLoader is crucial as it handles batching, shuffling, and loading data in parallel, which is essential for efficient model training.

# 2. Build the Model
Next, you define your neural network architecture. In PyTorch, models are created by defining a class that inherits from torch.nn.Module.

Inside this class, you define the layers of your network (e.g., nn.Linear, nn.Conv2d) in the __init__() method. The forward() method then specifies the computation by defining how the input data flows through these layers to produce an output. This is where the model's logic resides.

# 3. Train the Model
## Training: 
  It is an iterative process where the model learns to map inputs to correct outputs. This involves a training loop with several key components:

## Loss Function:  
  Measures how far the model's predictions are from the actual labels. Common choices include nn.CrossEntropyLoss for classification and nn.MSELoss for regression.

## Optimizer: 
  Adjusts the model's parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the loss. The torch.optim module provides various algorithms, with Adam and SGD being popular choices.

## Forward Pass:
  Input data is fed through the model to get predictions.

## Backward Pass:
  PyTorch's autograd engine calculates the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's parameters.

## Optimizer Step: 
  The optimizer updates the parameters based on the calculated gradients.

## 4. Evaluate and Predict
  After training, you evaluate the model's performance on unseen test data to ensure it generalizes well. This involves making predictions with the trained model and comparing them against the true labels. Once satisfied, the model is ready to make predictions on new, real-world data.
