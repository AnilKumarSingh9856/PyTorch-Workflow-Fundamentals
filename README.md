# PyTorch Workflow Fundamentals 🚀

Welcome to **PyTorch Workflow Fundamentals**!  
This repository is a hands-on guide to building, training, and evaluating machine learning models using PyTorch. If you're looking to understand the essential steps of a PyTorch-based ML project, you're in the right place.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- **How to prepare and load datasets for PyTorch**
- **Building neural network architectures from scratch**
- **Training models with custom loops (including loss and optimizers)**
- **Evaluating performance and making predictions**
- **Best practices and tips for real-world projects**

## 🛠️ PyTorch Workflow Overview

1. **Prepare and Load Data**
   - Load your dataset (CSV, images, etc.)
   - Convert data into **tensors**  
   - Use `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and `DataLoader` for efficient data management

2. **Build the Model**
   - Define your neural network by subclassing `torch.nn.Module`
   - Stack layers (`nn.Linear`, `nn.Conv2d`, etc.)
   - Implement the `forward()` method to define data flow

3. **Train the Model**
   - Set up a **loss function** (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, `nn.MSELoss`, etc.)
   - Choose an **optimizer** (`torch.optim.Adam`, `torch.optim.SGD`, etc.)
   - Loop through epochs:  
     - Forward pass → compute loss  
     - Backward pass → compute gradients  
     - Optimizer step → update parameters

4. **Evaluate and Predict**
   - Test your model on unseen data
   - Measure accuracy, loss, or other metrics
   - Use the model for inference
